# Naming :notebook:

Naming things (= variables, properties, functions, methods, classes) correctly and in an understandable way if an extremely important part of writing clean code.

*Be descriptive*
Names have one simple purpose: They should describe what's stored in a variable or property or what a function or method does. Or what kind of object will be created when instantiating a class.
