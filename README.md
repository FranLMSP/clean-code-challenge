# Naming :notebook:

Naming things (= variables, properties, functions, methods, classes) correctly and in an understandable way if an extremely important part of writing clean code.

**Be descriptive**, names have one simple purpose: They should describe what's stored in a variable or property or what a function or method does. Or what kind of object will be created when instantiating a class.

## Some ground rules!
| Variables & Constants  | Functions and Methods | Clases |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Data containers  | Commands or calculated values | Use to create "things"  |
| We use Nouns or short prhases with adjetives  | Use verbs or short phrases | Use nouns |
| Eg: userData, CONTANT_EMAIL | Eg: sendData(), print_document() | Ex: User(), ShoppingCart() |

**Exception:** Boolean variables, contants, functions and methods are better named as a Yes/No question
- **isUserValid** = True
- bool **inputIsValid()** {}
